# M3 - Requirements and Design

## 1. Change History
- Added new feature that allows users to view suggested quizzes and flashcards that are created by other users, algorithm recommends quizzes and flashcards most similar to what a user has been studying
    - Date of Modification: Feb 28
    - Modified Sections: 3.1, 3.3, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8
    - Rationale: new feature to showcase a complex algorithm that calculates document similarity with cosine similarity between a user's document and every other document that exists in the app.
- On document upload, flashcards and quizzes are generated as a background process for that document, so users can only create quizzes and flashcards from a document upload directly.
    - Date of Modification: Feb 26
    - Modified Sections: 3.1, 3.3, 4.4, 4.6
    - Rationale: this allows users to still browse the application while their study materials are generating as the processing of the documents are now unblocking; improves user experience.
- DocumentParser and DocumentSummarizer are no longer separate components but merged with DocumentService
    - Date of Modification: Feb 26
    - Modified Sections: 3.3, 4.4, 4.6
    - Rationale: There was no reason to decouple these functionalities together as they are very similar; text extraction or document text processing shouldn't be its own interface, but is just one part of the document upload processing.
- Changed subscription to be free
    - Date of Modification: Feb 24
    - Modified Sections: 3.3, 4.4, 4.6
    - Rationale: Payments are not central to the user application and to allow more users to test our chat feature, we decided to make it free for now.
- Coupled StudyResourceDB and UserDB into a single MongoDB database and defined MongoDB schemas for app resources
    - Date of Modification: Feb 25
    - Modified Sections: 4.2, 4.6
    - Rationale: There was no point in separating StudyResourcesDB and UserDB into two separate databases, it made more sense to keep them in one database but as separate collections in MongoDB to make finding user's owned documents easier and lessens complexity with a single DB. We defined the schemas to be able to represent application data in the database for flashcards, quizzes, documents, users, and chat so that data is saved.
- Google Authenticator is now only on the frontend and no longer used in the backend
    - Date of Modification: Feb 25
    - Modified Sections: 4.6
    - Rationale: Google authenticator is already used on the frontend, so doing it again on the backend was unneccessary.

- Frontend design changes:
    - landing screen only has the Google sign in button
    - payment screen allows users to start their free trial
    - document details screen was renamed to document upload screen, minor changes to the document upload screen design
    - loading page was removed, instead the document options screen has two different views, one when all study materials are ready, and one when the study materials are still being generated.

## 2. Project Description

Thinkr is an Android mobile app that is geared towards helping students study through AI-generated multiple-choice quizzes and notes. Students can upload a document, and quizzes and flashcards are automatically generated for that document, then they can view those quizzes and flashcards after. They may also ask a chatbot questions about the document uploaded. Students are also able to view quizzes and flashcards created by other users that are similar to theirs for extra study material.

### **4.5. Frameworks**

1. **AWS (Textract and EC2)**
    - **Purpose**: Used for deployment and extracting text from files.
    - **Reason**: AWS provides easy to access OCR tools and a quick way to deploy our backend onto the cloud.

2. **LangChain**
    - **Purpose**: For constructing input and output of RAG.
    - **Reason**: LangChain is one of the only services that can do vector comparison of the embeddings.

3. **Node.js**
    - **Purpose**: Used for backend development.
    - **Reason**: Node.js allows for efficient development of backend web services with TypeScript.

4. **Express.js**
    - **Purpose**: Used for backend development in the Node.js runtime environment.
    - **Reason**: Express.js allows for efficient development of REST APIs in the Node.js runtime environment.

5. **Jetpack Compose**
    - **Purpose**: Used for Android UI development.
    - **Reason**: Jetpack Compose allows for declarative implementation of UI in Kotlin for better maintainability, ease of UI testing with Compose testing, and intuitive use of Kotlin APIs.

6. **Retrofit**
    - **Purpose**: Type-safe HTTP Client for the JVM.
    - **Reason**: Retrofit allows us to consume REST APIs from the Android app to build scalable API calls.

7. **Ktor**
    - **Purpose**: Ktor WebSocket Client can be used to enable the real-time chat functionality with the chatbot.
    - **Reason**: Ktor integrates nicely with Kotlin APIs.

8. **MongoDB**
    - **Purpose**: Storing user account information.
    - **Reason**: Flexible NoSQL database that can be easily used for different scenarios.

9. **ChromaDB**

6. [**[View Suggested Study Materials From other users]**](#fr1)\
![View Suggested](./image/get-suggested-sequence-diagram.jpg)

### **4.7. Non-Functional Requirements Design**
1. [**[Quiz/flashcard generation performance]**](#nfr1)
    - **Validation**: We will implement a fan out pattern for extracting text from files by multithreading text extraction for each page (extract multiple pages at the same time). Also, while the user is providing information about the document, we will start uploading the document in the background so that the back-end can start parsing earlier to make quiz/flashcard generation appear a lot faster.
2. [**[Responsive UI/UX]**](#nfr1)
    - **Validation**: We will create loading animations for different front-end components, specifically for when the user is waiting for the document to be uploaded and parsed, or waiting for a reply from the back-end.

### **4.8. Main Project Complexity Design**

**Calculating Documents Similarity**
- **Description**: This feature (use case #7) suggests study materials (flashcards and quizzes) to users based on similarity between their documents and other users' documents. The core of this feature is the similarity calculation between users' documents to determine what flashcards and quizzes to show to a user that are similar to what they usually study.
- **Why complex?**: Vector similarity calculation requires multidimensional embedding comparison across potentially hundreds of documents. Cosine similarity computation between high-dimensional vectors is computationally intensive and must be optimized to maintain acceptable performance at scale. We are comparing a user's documents to every other user's documents in the system to find the most similar materials.
- **Design**:
   - **Input**: 
       - User ID (for whom to provide suggestions)
       - Optional limit parameter (maximum number of suggestions to return)
   - **Output**: 
       - Suggested flashcards from similar documents
       - Suggested quizzes from similar documents
   - **Main computational logic**: 
       - Retrieve all documents for the user
       - For each user document, find similar documents from other users using vector similarity
       - Sort results by similarity score and take top matches
       - Retrieve associated flashcards and quizzes for matching documents
   - **Pseudo-code**:
       ```python
       def get_suggested_materials(user_id, limit=5):
           # Get all documents for the user
           user_documents = get_user_documents(user_id)
           
           if empty(user_documents):
               return empty_result()
           
           # Find similar documents from other users
           similar_documents = find_similar_documents(user_id, user_documents, limit)
           
           if empty(similar_documents):
               return empty_result()
           
           # Fetch study materials for similar documents
           suggested_materials = {
               "flashcards": get_flashcards_for_documents(similar_documents),
               "quizzes": get_quizzes_for_documents(similar_documents)
           }
           
           return suggested_materials
       
       
       def find_similar_documents(user_id, user_documents, limit):
           # Get documents from other users
           other_users_documents = get_documents_excluding_user(user_id)
           
           # Calculate similarity between user documents and other users' documents
           similarity_results = []
           
           for user_doc in user_documents:
               user_doc_text = get_document_text(user_doc.id, user_id)
               
               for other_doc in other_users_documents:
                   other_doc_text = get_document_text(other_doc.id, other_doc.user_id)
                   
                   # Calculate vector similarity between documents
                   similarity_score = calculate_document_similarity(user_doc_text, other_doc_text)
                   
                   if similarity_score > SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD:
                       similarity_results.append({
                           "document": other_doc,
                           "score": similarity_score
                       })
           
           # Return top similar documents sorted by similarity score
           return get_top_results(similarity_results, limit)
       
       
       def calculate_document_similarity(text1, text2):
           # Convert texts to vector embeddings
           embedding1 = get_embedding(text1)
           embedding2 = get_embedding(text2)
           
           # Calculate cosine similarity between embeddings
           return cosine_similarity(embedding1, embedding2)
       ```
